## Requirements 

- Node.JS >= 8 (For async/await support)
- A C++ compiler for the node modules (OSX users should make sure they have the xcode command-line tools installed)
- Metamask browser plugin, set on Rinkeby testnet and with your mneumonic(seedphrase) saved
- Some ETH on your Rinkeby testnet wallet (use a faucet)
- An Infurio.io endpoint url (it takes 30 seconds to register and it is free)

## Configuration

- Run `npm install`
- Rename config.example.js to config.js
- Replace the values in it : mneumo should be your mneumonic (from metamask), and endpoint should be your Infurio endpoint link.
